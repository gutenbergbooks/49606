<p><i>The scene represents a wild, deserted place, the slope of a mountain
rising to infinite heights. In the rear of the stage, halfway up the
mountain, huge iron gates, tightly closed, indicate the boundary of
the world as we conceive it. Beyond the iron gates, which oppress the
earth with their enormous weight, in silence and in mystery, dwells the
Beginning of every being, the Supreme Wisdom of the universe.</i></p>

<p><i>At the foot of the Gates stands Someone guarding the entrances,
leaning upon a long sword, perfectly motionless. Garbed in wide
clothes, which are like stone in the motionlessness of their folds and
creases, He hides His face beneath a dark cover, and is Himself the
greatest of mysteries. Standing on the boundary separating two worlds,
he is dual in his make-up;&mdash;in appearance a man, in reality a spirit.
An arbitrator between two worlds, He is like unto a huge shield, which
gathers all bolts,&mdash;all looks, all entreaties, all expectations,
reproaches, and curses. The bearer of two elements, He wraps his speech
in silence, which is like the silence of the iron gates, and sometimes
in human words.</i></p>

<p><i>Amidst the rocks, looking around on all sides strangely and shyly,
appears Anathema, someone accursed. Clinging to the grey rocks,
himself grey, cautious and flexible, like a serpent seeking a hole,
he goes stealthily and quietly to the Guardian of the Entrances,
desiring to strike him with an unexpected blow. But he is frightened
by his own audacity and, jumping to his feet, laughs defiantly and
maliciously. Then he sits down on a rock, with an air of freedom and
independence, and throws small cobblestones at the feet of the Guardian
of the Entrances;&mdash;cunning, he conceals his fear beneath the mask of
raillery and slight audacity. In the faint, grey, almost colorless
light, the head of the accursed one seems enormous; especially large
is his high forehead, which is furrowed by wrinkles of fruitless
reflections and unsolvable eternal problems. Anathema's thin beard is
perfectly grey; his hair, once jet black, is also greyish, rising on
his head in disordered tufts. Restless in his movements, he is vainly
trying to conceal his alarm and his purposeless haste, which are
forever devouring him. Endeavoring to emulate the proud stillness of
the Guardian of the Entrances, he grows quiet for an instant in the
pose of proud majesty, but the very next moment, in painful quest after
the eternally elusive, he wriggles in mute spasms, like a worm under
foot. And in his questions he is rapid and impetuous like a whirlwind,
drawing strength and fury in his mad whirl....</i></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>You are still here on guard? And I thought you were away,&mdash;even a
chained dog has his moments of rest or sleep, even though the whole
world be his kennel and Eternity his master! Is Eternity afraid of
thieves? But do not be angry. I have come to you as a good friend and
I implore humbly: Open the heavy Gates for an instant and allow me to
have a glimpse of Eternity. You dare not? But perhaps the mighty gates
have cracked from age, and the unfortunate, honest Anathema could peep
into the narrow cleft, without disturbing any one,&mdash;show me it with a
sign. Softly, on my belly, will I crawl over, I will glance at it and
crawl back,&mdash;and He will not know. But I shall know and become a God,
become a God, a God! I have so long wanted to become a God&mdash;and would I
be a poor God? Look!</p>

<p><i>He assumes a haughty pose, but immediately bursts into laughter. Then
he sits down calmly on a flat rock and, folding his legs under him,
takes out dice. He mutters something to himself, yet loud enough to be
heard by the Guardian of the Entrances.</i></p>

<p>If you don't want to you need not do it,&mdash;I shall not fight with you.
Have I come here for that purpose? I simply roamed about the world and
came here by mere accident&mdash;I have nothing to do, so I roam about. And
now I am going to throw dice. If He were not so serious, I would have
invited Him, too,&mdash;but He is too proud, too proud, and He does not
understand the pleasure of the game. Six, eight, twenty&mdash;correct! It's
always correct when the Devil plays, even when he plays honestly....
David Leizer ... David Leizer ...</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Turning to the Guardian of the Entrances, he
speaks freely.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Do you know David Leizer? You surely do not know him. He is a sick and
foolish old Jew, whom no one knows, and even your Master has forgotten
about him. So says David Leizer, and I cannot help believing him&mdash;he is
a foolish, but honest man. He is the man I have won just now with my
dice&mdash;you saw it: six, eight, twenty.... One day I met David Leizer by
the seashore, when he was questioning what the waves were complaining
of; and I liked him. He is a foolish, but honest man, and if he should
be well tarred and lighted, he would make a brilliant torch for my
feast.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Chatting with feigned ease, he steps over softly
to the rock nearest the Guardian.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>No one knows David Leizer, but I shall make him famous, I shall make
him mighty and great&mdash;it is very possible that I shall even make him
immortal! You do not believe me? No one believes the wise Anathema,
even when he speaks the truth&mdash;and who loves the truth more than
Anathema does? Perhaps you? You silent dog, you who have stolen the
truth from the world, you who have barred the entrances with iron!...</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He rushes furiously toward the Guardian of the
Entrances, but retreats from the stern, motionless
Guardian, with a shriek of horror and pain. And he
speaks plaintively, falling with his grey chest
upon the grey rock.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, the Devil's hair is grey! Weep, you who have grown fond of
Anathema! Wail and grieve, you who are striving toward Truth, who are
honoring wisdom&mdash;Anathema's hair is grey! Who will help the son of
Dawn? He is alone in the universe. Wherefore, O Great One, have you
frightened the fearless Anathema&mdash;he did not intend to strike you, he
only wanted to approach you. May I come over to you? Tell me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Guardian of the Entrances is silent, but to
Anathema it seems that he hears something in the
silence. Outstretching his serpentine neck, he
shouts passionately</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Louder! Louder! Are you silent, or did you speak? I do not understand.
The accursed one has a sensitive ear and discerns the shades of certain
words in your silence; he feels a vague movement of thoughts in your
motionlessness,&mdash;but he does not understand. Did you speak or are you
silent? Did you say: "Come," or did it only sound so to me?</p>

<p class="char">THE GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>Come.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>You said it, but I dare not come up to you.</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>Come.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>I am afraid.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He advances toward the Guardian irresolutely,
in zigzag movements; lies down on his belly and
crawls, wailing with longing and fear.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, I the prince of darkness, wise and powerful, and yet you see&mdash;I am
crawling on my belly like a dog. And I am doing it because I love you,
I want to kiss the hem of your cloak. But why does my old heart ache
so much? Tell me, Omniscient.</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>The accursed one has no heart.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Advancing.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes. The accursed has no heart, his chest is mute and motionless
like the grey rock which does not breathe. Oh, if Anathema had a heart,
you would have destroyed him long ago by his sufferings, even as you
destroy the foolish man. But Anathema has a mind that is searching for
the Truth, unprotected against your blows&mdash;spare it.... Here I am at
your feet, reveal your face to me. Only for an instant, as brief as the
flash of lightning,&mdash;reveal your face to me.</p>

<p><i>He cringes servilely at the feet of the Guardian, not daring, however,
to touch his cloak. He is vainly endeavoring to lower his eyes, which
are quick and searching, sharp, flashing like coals beneath grey
ashes. The Guardian is silent and Anathema continues his fruitless and
persistent entreaties.</i></p>

<p>Do you not want to do it? Then call the name of Him who is beyond the
Gates. Call it in a soft voice, and no one will hear it; only I will
know it, the wise Anathema, longing for Truth. Is it not true that
it consists of seven letters? Or of six? Or of one? Tell me. Only one
letter&mdash;and you will save the accursed one from eternal tortures, and
the earth, which I am tearing with my nails, will bless you. You may
say it softly, softly, you may only breathe it, and I shall understand
it, and I shall bless you.... Tell me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Guardian is silent, and Anathema, after some
hesitation, full of fury, crawls away slowly,
growing holder with every step.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not true that I love you.... It is not true that I wanted to kiss
the hem of your cloak.... I feel sorry for you, if you believed me....
I simply have nothing to do, so I roam about in the world.... I have
nothing to do, so I question the passers-by about this and that,&mdash;about
things I know myself.... I know everything!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He rises, shakes himself like a dog that has just
come out of the water, and choosing the highest
rock, stands up there in a haughty, actorlike pose.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I know everything. With my wisdom I have penetrated the meaning of all
things, the laws of numbers are known to me, and the book of Fates is
open to me. At one glance I embrace life, I am the axis in the circle
of time, which whirls rapidly. I am great, I am mighty, I am immortal,
and man is in my power. Who will dare struggle with the Devil? The
strong, I kill, and the weak I force to whirl about in an intoxicating
dance, a mad dance, a devilish dance. I have poisoned all the sources
of life, on all its roads I have built ambuscades.... Do you hear the
voice of those who curse? The voice of those who are exhausted under
the burden of evil? Of those who dare in vain? Of those who long
endlessly and terribly?</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Laughing.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The name! Call the name! Illumine the way for the Devil and for man.
All in the world want goodness, but know not where to find it; all in
the world want fife, but meet only death. The name! Call the name of
goodness, call the name of eternal life. I am waiting!</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>There is no name for that which you ask, Anathema. There is no number
by which to count, no measure by which to measure, no scales by which
to weigh that which you ask, Anathema. Every one who has said the word,
Love, has lied. Every one who has said the word, Wisdom,&mdash;has lied. And
even he who has uttered the word, God,&mdash;has lied with the greatest and
most terrible lie. For there is no number, no measure, no scale, no
name for that which you ask, Anathema.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Where shall I go? Tell me.</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>Where you are going.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>What shall I do? Tell me.</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>What you are doing.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>You speak through silence&mdash;can I understand the language of your
silence? Tell me.</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>No. Never. My face is open, but you see it not. My speech is loud,
but you hear it not. My commands are clear, but you know them not,
Anathema. And you shall never see, and you shall never hear, and you
shall never know, Anathema, unfortunate spirit, deathless in numbers,
eternally alive in measures and in weights, but as yet unborn to life.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Tormented.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Never?</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p><i>Anathema leaps down from the rocks, and tosses about madly, devoured
by grief. Clinging to the rocks, he embraces them tenderly and then
pushes them away angrily; he moans bitterly. He turns his face to West
and East, to North and South of the earth, flourishing his arms, as
if calling the earth to wrath and vengeance. But the grey rocks are
silent, West and East are silent, North and South are silent, and in
stern motionlessness, heavily leaning on his sword, stands the Guardian
of the Entrances.</i></p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Rise, O Earth! Rise, O Earth, and gird your sword, O man. There will be
no peace between you and Heaven; the earth is becoming the abode of
darkness and death, and the Prince of Darkness ascends to his throne
upon it&mdash;from now on and forever. I am going to you, David. I will hurl
your sad life towards the proud heaven like a stone from a sling&mdash;and
the foundations of the high heavens will tremble. My slave, David! With
your lips I will proclaim the truth about the fate of man.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He turns to the Guardian of the Entrances.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And you!...</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He becomes silent, bashfully, confused by the
Silence. He stretches himself lazily, as from
tediousness, and mutters in a voice loud enough to
be heard by the Guardian of the Entrances.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But am I not roaming about, because I have nothing to do? I have been
here, and now I shall go there. Are there not plenty of roads for the
gay Anathema, who is fond of healthy laughter and a carefree jest?
Six.... That means that I bring to David a fortune which he does not
expect.... Eight.... That means that David Leizer is healing the sick
and reviving the dead. Twenty.... Correct! That means ... That means
that David and I come to express our gratitude. David Leizer, the
great, the powerful, the immortal David Leizer and I.... I am going.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Anathema departs.</i></p>

<p><i>Silence. The rocks are silent; the mute Gates,
pressing the earth with their enormous weight, are
silent; the Guardian, petrified, is silent.</i></p>

<p><i>Silence. But did not Anathema's footsteps awaken
an alarming, resounding echo? One, two&mdash;some heavy
steps are heard coming. It is like one footstep,
but many people are coming; they are silent, but
the silence is already quivering. A momentary
confusion of sounds, of helplessness and tremulous
outbursts, and suddenly the silence breaks out in
high yellow flames of fire: somewhere below, in
the invisible distance, on earth, long trumpets,
carried by hands uplifted high, are blaring in
rebellious, brasslike tones,&mdash;their defiant cry of
revolt is turned both to earth and to Heaven.</i></p>

<p><i>One, two,&mdash;now it is clear that a crowd is moving;
its monstrous voice, its blended and separate sobs,
its noisy and stormy speech is heard; and below,
in the labyrinth from broken and dark passages,
the first distinct sound rings out: "Da-a-vid!" It
grows more distinct, rises higher, and now it soars
overhead</i>-<i>on the wings of this brass fanfare,
above the heavy stamping of the marching feet.</i></p>


<p><i>"Da-a-vid! Da-a-a-vid! Da-a-a-vid!"</i></p>

<p><i>The sounds blend harmoniously. They become the
song of millions of people. The trumpets are
blaring, exhausted; they call hoarsely with their
brass voices&mdash;</i></p>

<p><i>Does the Guardian of the Entrances hear them? The
grey rocks are covered with moans; passionate sobs
rise to His feet, but the Guardian is motionless,
the Guardian is speechless, and the iron Gates are
mute.</i></p>

<p><i>The abyss crashes.</i></p>

<p><i>With one blow, as if splitting the earth, a brass
roar and shout breaks forth,&mdash;and out of the
fragments, like a spring from a rock that is split
by lightning, a soft, harmonious, bright melody
comes forth.</i></p>

<p><i>Then it dies out.</i></p>

<p><i>Silence. Immobility. Expectation, expectation,
expectation.</i></p></blockquote>

<h5>CURTAIN</h5>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="ACT_ONE" id="ACT_ONE">ACT ONE</a></h4>


<p><i>The south of Russia. A hot summer midday. A wide road near the end
of a large, thickly populated city. Starting from the left corner of
the stage, the road crosses it diagonally, turning in the rear of the
stage to the right. Two high stone posts, of ancient construction,
dilapidated and slightly bent, indicate the boundary of the city. On
the side of the city line, at the right post, there is a deserted,
once yellow sentry-box, the plaster fallen of in spots and the windows
tightly boarded and nailed up. On the sides of the road there are
several small shops made of cheap wood, separated from one another
by narrow passages&mdash;in the desperate and ineffectual struggle for
existence the little shops seem to be clambering stupidly upon one
another. The people are dealing in all sorts of merchandise: candies,
sunflower seeds, cheap sausages, herrings; each shop has a small,
dirty counter, through which a pipe with two faucets stands out
prominently&mdash;one of them for soda-water, at a penny a glass,&mdash;the other
for seltzer. One of the little shops belongs to David Leizer; the
others&mdash;to the Greek Purikes, to the young Jewess Sonka Zitron, and to
the Russian, Ivan Bezkrainy, who, in addition to his business, mends
shoes and rubbers; he is the only one who has "real noblemen's" cider
for sale.</i></p>

<p><i>The sun is burning mercilessly and the few small trees, with their
leaves curled up from the heat, are pining for rain; the dusty road is
deserted. Beyond the posts, where the road is turning toward the right,
there is a high precipice&mdash;the dust-covered tops of trees are seen here
and there in the descending distance. And embracing the entire horizon,
the sea has stretched itself in a smoky blue strip, sleeping peacefully
in the heat and glare of the sun.</i></p>

<p><i>Sarah, David Leizer's wife, an old Jewess, exhausted by life, is
seated in front of her little shop. She is mending some rags and is
chatting languidly with the other shopkeepers.</i></p>


<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>No one is buying anything. No one is drinking any soda-water; no one is
buying any sunflower seeds or any fine candies which melt in the mouth.</p>

<p class="char">PURIKES.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Like an echo.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>No one is buying anything.</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>One might think that all the people have died so as not to buy
anything. One might think that we remained alone with our stores in
the whole world&mdash;we alone in the whole world.</p>

<p class="char">PURIKES.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Like an echo.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We alone.</p>

<p class="char">BEZKRAINY.</p>

<p>The sun has burnt all the customers&mdash;only the shopkeepers remained.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Silence. The soft sobbing of Sonka is heard.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">BEZKRAINY.</p>

<p>Sonka, yesterday you bought a chicken. Did you kill or rob anybody that
you can afford to buy chickens? And if you are so rich and you hide
your money, why do you deal here and hinder us from making a living?</p>

<p class="char">PURIKES.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Like an echo.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And hinder us from making a living?</p>

<p class="char">BEZKRAINY.</p>

<p>Sonka, I am asking you,&mdash;is it true that you bought a chicken
yesterday? Don't lie, I know it from trustworthy people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Sonka maintains silence, weeping.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>When a Jew buys a chicken, it is because either the Jew is sick or the
chicken is sick. Sonka Zitron's son is dying; yesterday he commenced
to die and to-day he will end it&mdash;the boy is tenacious and he is dying
slowly.</p>

<p>Yesterday we ate nothing, we waited for to-day; and to-day we will eat
nothing, waiting that to-morrow will bring us customers and happiness.
Happiness! Who knows what is happiness? All people are equal before
God, and yet one sells two cents' worth, while another sells thirty
cents' worth. And one always two cents' worth, while the other always
thirty cents' worth, and no one knows why happiness is given to a
person.</p>

<p class="char">BEZKRAINY.</p>

<p>I used to sell thirty cents' worth, and now I sell only two cents'
worth. At that time I had no "noblemen's" cider, and now I have it, and
yet I sell only two cents' worth now. Luck is changeable!</p>

<p>Yesterday my son Naum came and asked me: "Mother, where is father?" So
I said to him: "What for do you want to know where father is? David
Leizer, your father, is a sick, unfortunate man, who is going to die
soon; and he goes to the seashore to commune in solitude with God about
his fate. Don't disturb your father, he is going to die soon&mdash;you had
better tell me what you want to say." And Naum answered: "I will tell
you, mother,&mdash;I am beginning to die!" That is what Naum answered. When
David Leizer, my old husband, came home, I said to him: "You are still
steadfast in your uprightness! Blaspheme God and die! For your son Naum
is already beginning to die."</p>

only his necktie is white, lending a solemn air to
his costume. He is tall, and, though grey-haired,
straight and stately. The face of the accursed one
is of a swarthy-grey color; his features are stern
and of peculiar beauty. When Anathema takes off his
hat, his enormous forehead is revealed, furrowed
by wrinkles. His head is unusually large and his
greyish black hair is dishevelled. Anathema's neck
is wiry and strong, but it is rather thin and long,
and in his nervous contortions he carries his head
like a heavy weight, giving it the appearance

malignity.</i></p></blockquote>

much money.</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p><i>Frowning.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>No, he is sick and old and unable to work. But he has not sinned
against God or man in any way, and even his enemies dare not say
anything bad about him. Here is some seltzer, sir, it is better than
soda. And if you are not afraid of the heat, I would ask you to sit
down and wait a while; David will soon be here.</p>

around because he has to get credit. Then, sir, we have a daughter,
and her name is Rosa. But unfortunately she is too beautiful, too
beautiful, sir. Happiness what is happiness? One person dies of
smallpox, while another person needs smallpox, but it would not come,

Himself.</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>Who knows? It may be a gift from God, and it may be a gift from
somebody else of whom I would not speak. But there is one thing I do
not know; why has a man beautiful eyes, if he must hide them? Why has
he a white face, if he must cover it with soot and filth? Beauty is a
too dangerous treasure, for it is easier to hide money from a robber,
than beauty from a wicked man. (<i>Suspiciously.</i>) Did you come perhaps
to see Rosa? Then you better go away,&mdash;Rosa is not here, and I will not
tell you where she is.</p>

indignation. He laughs, inappropriately, thereby
frightening and surprising the people.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>That's right, Ivan, thank you. But who told you, sir, that our Rosa is
beautiful? It is not true&mdash;don't laugh, it isn't true, she is as ugly
as deadly sin. She is as filthy as a dog that has just crawled out of
the coal-hole of a ship; her face is furrowed by smallpox and it looks
like a field where people dig lime and sand; there is on her right eye
a cataract as large as on an old horse. Look at her hair&mdash;it is like
faded wool, half torn away by birds; and when she walks, she stoops,&mdash;I
swear to you, she stoops when she walks! If you take her, everybody

<p>I have nothing to do, so I wander over the world.</p>

appears David Leizer, walking slowly. He is tall,
bony, with long, grey locks and a grey beard; on
his head he wears a high, black cap; in his hand a

looks down from under his heavy eyebrows; and thus,

the staff with both hands.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What did the waves tell you, David?</p>

my four children were devoured by hunger and diseases&mdash;and now, when
I must die, he brings me four millions. Will they return to me my
youth which I passed in privation, oppressed with grief, wrapped with
sorrows, crowned with anguish? Will they repay me for one day of my
starvation, one tear that fell upon a rock, one insult hurled at my
face? Four million curses&mdash;that's what your four million roubles

winter&mdash;what will you say if your father should touch this money? No, I

I don't need any money. I don't see God in this. But I shall go to Him,

<p><i>David Leizer lives richly. At the urgent request of his wife and his
children he has hired a rich villa, by the sea-shore, engaged numerous
servants, bought horses and carriages. Anathema, under the pretext that
he had grown tired of his law practice, remained with David as his
private secretary. Rosa is taking lessons in languages and deportment.
Naum, who has grown very sick, near to death, is learning how to dance.
The money has not yet arrived from America, but to David Leizer, the
millionaire, a large credit has been extended.</i></p>

<p><i>The stage represents a rich parlor, white marble here and there, with
large Italian windows and a door leading to a veranda. It is midday.
Beyond the open windows, semi-tropical plants are visible, and the deep
blue sea in the distance; through one of the windows, a view of the
city is seen.</i></p>

<p><i>David Leizer is seated by the table, greatly depressed. A short
distance away, on a divan, Sarah is seated, dressed richly, but without
taste; she watches Naum learning how to dance. Naum is very pale, he
coughs and almost falls from weakness, especially when, according to
the rules of the dance, he must stand on one foot; but he is studying
diligently! He is dressed rather richly, but his bright-colored vest
and necktie spoil the elegance of his appearance. Near Naum, the
dancing-master, with a fiddle and how, is hustling about, balancing
himself, rising up and down. He is a man of unusual refinement and
grace; he wears a white vest, patent-leather slippers, and a smoking
jacket. And Anathema, standing at the veranda door, looks upon all this
with an air of sadness and reproach.</i></p>

<p>What are you thinking of, David? Allow me to be not only your private

Since the time when you received the money you are oppressed by a dark
sorrow, and it pains me to look at you.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>What is there that I should rejoice over, Nullius?</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>And Rosa? Do not sin against God, David! Do not our eyes rest upon her
beauty and youth? Before even the silent moon dared not look at her,
one star dared not whisper about her to any other star,&mdash;while now she
is riding about in a carriage, and everybody looks at her, and horsemen
gallop after her. Just think of it, Nullius, horsemen gallop after her!</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>And Naum?</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>What about Naum? He has long been ill, you know it, and death upon a
soft bed is not worse than death upon the pavement. And perhaps he
will live yet, he will live yet (<i>cries.</i>) David, Abraham Khessin and
Sonka's girl are waiting for you in the yard.</p>

<p>What do they want, money? Sarah, give them a few pennies and let them

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>In the end they will draw out all the money we have, Nullius. I have
given to Khessin twice already. He is like sand,&mdash;no matter how much
water you pour into it, it is always dry and greedy.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Nonsense! we have too much money, Sarah. But it pains me to look at the
people, Nullius. Since the time when you brought us this fortune&mdash;</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Which you earned by your sufferings, Leizer.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Since that time, the people have changed so much for the worse. You
like to have the people bow to you very low, Nullius? I do not like
it&mdash;human beings are not dogs that they should crawl on their bellies.
And you like to have the people tell you, Nullius, that you are the
wisest, the most magnanimous, the best of all living beings&mdash;whereas
you are only an ordinary old Jew, like many another Jew. I do not
like it, Nullius,&mdash;for the sons of the God of truth and mercy it is

<p>Yes? Should I, perhaps, also engage a dancing-master? What do you
advise me, Nullius?</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>Don't forget Rosa, father. Is it not a great sin against God to hide
the beauty of the face? It is given as a joy and a pleasure to the
eyes; God Himself reveals His beauty in a beautiful face, and did we
not lift our hands against God Himself when we stained our Rosa's face
with coal and soot, when we made her terrible and sorrowful to look
upon?</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Beauty is withering. Everything is dying, Sarah.</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>But the lily also withers, and the narcissus dies, the petals of the
yellow rose fall apart&mdash;would you, David, trample all flowers under
foot and heap abuse upon the yellow rose? Do not doubt, David,&mdash;the
God of righteousness has given you riches&mdash;will you who were so firm in
misfortune that you did not blaspheme God even once&mdash;will you grow weak
in your happiness?</p>

my very bones,&mdash;but my old stomach refuses to accept any food; I want
to laugh, but my face is sobbing, my eyes are weeping, and my soul is

Your death consists of this, David Leizer,&mdash;blinded by misfortunes,
like a horse that is turning around in the darkness, you failed to

illness and your riches. There in the yard Life is waiting for you&mdash;and

birds.... Verily, You have saved me upon the edge of the abyss, and You
have torn my spirit away from the clutches of the Devil. He who looks

bed-curtain and will watch how the children are eating. They need so
little; they eat a little crust of bread and they have enough; they
drink a cup of milk and they know no thirst any longer. Then they
sing&mdash;But how strange! does not the night pass away when the sun comes?
do not the waves, at the end of the storm, lie down calmly and quietly
like lambs resting in the pasture? Whence came the alarm, the slight
confusion, and the fear? Shades of unknown woes are passing over my
soul and soaring noiselessly over my thoughts. Ah, if I remained poor,
if I remained unknown, under the shade of the fence where the refuse is
cast away! You have lifted me to the peak of the mountain and You show
my old, sorrowful face to the world. But such is Your will. You will
command&mdash;and the lamb will become a lion; You will command&mdash;and the
furious lion will stretch out her powerful breasts to her little ones;
You will command&mdash;and David Leizer, who has grown white in shade, will

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Thank you, Nullius. Now take ink and paper and sit down near me, by the
table; bring me my old counting-board.... As everything I am about to
say is very important, I ask you to write it correctly and to make no
errors&mdash;we shall give an account of every word before God. I ask you
all to rise and listen attentively, striving to understand the great
words which I am about to utter.</p>

<p>Do not interrupt me, Nullius. Yes, it does mean four million roubles.
And now, submitting to the voice of my conscience and the command of
God, and also in memory of my children, Hannah, Benjamin, Raphael, and
Moses, who died of hunger and disease in their childhood....</p>

<p>Let your hearts rejoice, O unfortunate people, and with a smile on your
lips answer the mercy of Heaven. Go from here to the city, like heralds
of happiness,&mdash;go through all its streets and squares, and shout
everywhere: "David Leizer, the old Jew, who is to die soon, received
an inheritance and now distributes it among the poor." And if you will
see a man weeping, and a child whose face is bloodless and whose eyes
are dim, and a woman whose breasts are shrunken like those of an old
goat,&mdash;tell them also: "Go, David is calling you." Do I speak properly,
Nullius?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Yes, yes. But have you called all those who should be called?</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>And if you should see an intoxicated man slumbering amidst his
vomitings, wake him and tell him: "Go, David is calling you." And if
you should see a thief thrashed in the market-place by those he had
robbed, call him also, with words of kindness, yet firm enough to be
regarded as a command: "Go, David is calling you." And if you should
see people who in their misery have become irritated and furious and
who are beating one another with sticks and bits of brick, announce to
them also in words of peace: "Go, David is calling you." And if you
should see a bashful man, who while walking in the wide street lowers
his eyes before the eyes of others, but who stares greedily when no
one looks at him, tell him also in a low voice, without offending his
pride: "Are you not looking for David? Go, he has long been waiting for
you." And if in the evening, when the Devil sows the seeds of night
over the earth, you should see a woman, hideously painted, just as the
heathen paint the bodies of their dead, and who stares boldly, for she
has lost all shame, and who lifts her shoulders, for fear of a blow,
tell her also: "Go, David is calling you." Do I speak properly, Nullius?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Yes, David. But have you called all who should be called?</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>And whatever form of aversion or fear poverty may assume, and in
whatever colors misery may paint itself, and by whatever words
suffering may fence itself around, rouse with a loud call those who
are fatigued, in words of life return life to those who are dying! Do
not trust the silence and the darkness if they obstruct your way like
a wall: Shout more loudly into the silence and the darkness, for there
dwells unspeakable horror.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>That's right, David, that's right! I see how your spirit climbs to the
peak of the mountain and how you knock loudly at the iron gates of
eternity: Open! I love you, David, I kiss your hand, David,&mdash;like a dog
I am ready to crawl before you and to obey your commandments. Call,
David, call! Rise, O earth! North and South, East and West, I command
you, by the will of David, my master, answer the call of him who calls
you, and stop at his feet like four oceans of tears. Call, David, call!</p>

Perhaps you will ask for a powder that destroys the fleas? Ask; we
shall give you everything.</p>

<p>Be quiet, Nullius, be quiet. We must work. You are an expert at
counting, Nullius, are you not?</p>

<p>I? Oh, Rabbi David! I am myself Numbers, I am myself&mdash;Measures and
Weights.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Be seated, then; write and count. But there is one more thing, my dear
children: I am an old Jew, who can divide a piece of garlic into ten
portions. I know not only the need of man, but I saw also how a roach
was starving&mdash;yes,&mdash;I saw also how small children died of hunger....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Lowers his head and heaves a deep sigh.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore do not deceive me, and remember that there is a number and a
measure for everything. And where ten copecks are needed, do not ask
for twenty, and where one measure of grain is needed, do not ask for
two, for what is superfluous for one is always essential to another.
Like brothers having one mother whose breasts are full but are quickly
exhausted, do not abuse one another, and do not offend the generous but
careful mother.... You may begin. Nullius, is everything ready?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>You may begin. I am waiting, David.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Stand in line, then, I beg you. I have not received the money yet; it
is still in America, but I shall write down exactly how much each one
of you is to get according to his need.</p>

sentinel-box; the same little shops. The sun is burning as mercilessly
as when Anathema first appeared there.</i></p>

<p><i>A large number of poor people are gathered there to welcome David
Leizer, who had distributed his fortune among the poor. The air is
rent by shouting, motion, and merry bustling. Purikes, Bezkrainy, and
Sonka, happy now, and proud of their shops, are doing a brisk business
in soda-water and candies. Sarah Leizer is sitting as before near her
little shop, dressed neatly but poorly.</i></p>

<p><i>A solemn welcome is arranged for David and Anathema, who had gone to
the seashore. All the little shops, even the posts and the deserted
sentinel-box, are decorated with parti-colored rags and with branches
of trees; on the right side of the road, upon the scorched grass,
an orchestra is preparing to meet David&mdash;several Jews with various
instruments, among which there are: a good violin, cymbals, a broken
brass trumpet, and even a drum, slightly broken. The members of
the orchestra are scolding one another criticizing each other's
instruments.</i></p>

<p><i>There are a number of children in the crowd. Also, little babes in
arms. Abraham Khessin and those who were in line when David started to
distribute his money are there; a little distance away from the crowd
stands the stern organ-grinder, with his organ.</i></p>

<p>Don't get excited, Leibke. You are a very talented man, and your music

<p class="char">VIOLINIST.</p>

<p>But I can't bear it. You are a very honorable man, Abraham Khessin, you
have lived long in the world, but have you ever seen such a big hole in
a drum?</p>

<p class="char">KHESSIN.</p>

<p>No, Leibke, I haven't seen such a big hole, but that is not at all
important. David Leizer was a multimillionaire, he had twenty million
roubles, but he is unspoiled and humble, and your love will afford
him joy. Does the soul need a drum to be able to express its love?
I see here people who have neither drums nor trumpets, and who weep
for happiness&mdash;their tears are noiseless like the dew.&mdash;Rise higher,
Leibke, rise a little higher to the sky, and you will not hear any
drums there, but therefore you will hear the tears falling.</p>

<p>You mustn't quarrel and darken the days of bright happiness,&mdash;that
would be disagreeable to David.</p>

beautiful of all girls on earth?</p>

<p>David is not an ordinary man. Who ever saw an ordinary man who was
more a mother to a child than his own mother? Who hides behind the
bed-curtain and watches how other people's children are eating, and who
weeps for joy at the sight of them? Of whom even the tiniest children
are not afraid, and they play with his venerable beard as with the
beard of their grandfather? Did not the stupid little Rubin tear out a
tuft of grey hair from David Leizer's venerable beard? Did David grow
angry? Did he cry out for pain, did he stamp his feet? No, he began to
laugh as if overcome with happiness, and he cried as though for joy.</p>

me. I'll spend it on drink in the nearest dram-shop." That's what I
had to tell him, for although I am a drunkard, I am an honest man. And
the queer David answered me jestingly, like a good-natured lunatic:
"Semyon, if it pleases you to drink, please drink,&mdash;I have not come to
teach the people but to bring them joy."</p>

<p class="char">OLD JEW.</p>

hand. Leibke, bustling about desperately, gets
his orchestra together and they begin to play a
lively wild tune which is as discordant as the
fluttering parti-colored rags. Shouting, laughter,
the children are rushing forward, some one is
crying; many people are outstretching their hands
prayerfully to David. Then David moves forward
amidst this chaos of lively sounds. The crowd makes
room for him to pass; many throw branches and twigs
on the ground and spread their clothes before him;
women tear of their head-dress and throw it at
his feet on the dusty road. Thus he walks over to
Sarah, who rises and welcomes him together with the
other women. The music stops. But David is silent.
Confusion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">KHESSIN.</p>

<p>Why are you silent, David? The people you have made happy are greeting
you and spreading their clothing before you on the ground, for their
love is great and their hearts cannot comprise all their joy. Say a
word to them&mdash;they are waiting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>David remains standing, with lowered eyes; with
both hands he is leaning on his staff; his face is
stern and serious. Anathema looks at him, over his
shoulder, with alarm.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>They are waiting for you, David. Say unto them a word of joy and calm
their love.</p>

<p>Why are you silent, David? You frighten us. Are you not the David who
brings joy to mankind?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Impatiently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Speak, David. Their agitated ears are waiting for a word of joy and by
your silence, which is like the dumbness of the rock, you crush their
soul to the earth. Speak!</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Lifting his eyes and surveying the crowd sternly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore these honors and the noise of voices, and the music which
plays so loudly? To whom do you render honors worthy of a prince or of
one who has performed a great deed? Is it before me, before a poor old
man who must die soon, that you spread out your clothes upon the ground?
What have I done to deserve your delight and exultation, to force tears
of senseless joy from your eyes? I gave you money and bread&mdash;but that
was the money of the Uppermost, it came from Him and went back to Him
through you. The only thing I have done was not to hide the money like
a thief, I did not become a plunderer, like those who have forgotten
God. Do I speak properly, Nullius?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>No, David, no. Your speech is not worthy of a wise man and it does not
come forth from the lips of a humble man.</p>

<p class="char">OLD MAN.</p>

<p>Bread without love is like grass without salt,&mdash;the stomach may
be filled, but it leaves a bad taste in the mouth, and a bitter
recollection.</p>

<p>Have I forgotten anything, Nullius? Remind me, my friend: I am old and
my eyesight is poor, but do I not see musicians there, Nullius? Tell
me! Do I not see flags as red as the tongues of crows over my head?
Tell me, Nullius.</p>

the people's exultation I did not raise my eyes to Heaven, but lowered
them to the ground,&mdash;bad old man that I am. Whom did I want to deceive
with my insincerity? Do I not live by day and night in raptures of
joy, and do I not draw love and happiness with full hands? Why have I
feigned sadness?... I do not know your name, woman; give me your child,
the one that is laughing when everybody is crying, because he alone is
sensible.</p>

But after all, Sarah and I cannot live much longer, and we should like
to rest our eyes upon the wonderful beauty of God's land. But why do
you address me as a stranger, old friend? Have you not yet forgiven me?</p>

you. You are not an ordinary man, David.</p>

<p>I am not an ordinary man. I am a happy man. But where is the gay man
Nullius? I don't see him. I suppose he is preparing some prank or
another&mdash;I know him. There is a man who does not darken the face of the
earth with gloom, Abraham, who is never averse to laughter, which is to
life like dew upon grass, and which sparkles in many colors in the rays
of the sun. Of course he is playing his pranks; do you hear?</p>

Together with the music the crowd appears in a
solemn procession. At the head of the procession,
side by side with the Organ-grinder, walks
Anathema, as if dancing. He carries the organ on a
strap and turns the handle with one hand, keeping
time with the other hand, whistling shrilly, and
casting glances on all sides and skyward. The
musicians and the poor, now gay, follow him.
On passing David, Anathema bends his head toward him

the fate of man? I was poor, alone, and near death, a foolish old man,
seeking an answer from the waves. But now people have come&mdash;Am I alone
now? Am I poor and near death? Listen to me, Nullius; there is no death
for man. What death is there? What is death? Who was the mournful one

<p>It was my dream, Nullius, to die in the Holy City and to join my dust

they are human beings. The grey dust has equalized
them&mdash;their distress and their suffering have made

dull, inflexible movement&mdash;and the people look upon

<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="ACT_FOUR" id="ACT_FOUR">ACT FOUR</a></h4>


<p><i>A large, high, somewhat dark room&mdash;David's study in the rich villa
where he spends his last days. Two large windows in the room: one
overlooking the road to the city; the other, on the left, overlooking
the garden. Near this window, a large writing-table, covered with
papers in disorder&mdash;sheets of paper of various sizes, and large
books. Under the table, and near it, paper torn into small bits. A
large Bible, bound in old leather, lies on the floor, open, with its
back upward, resembling the roof of a house which is falling apart.
Notwithstanding the heal, there is a fire in the fireplace. David
Leizer feels cold and feverish.</i></p>

<p><i>It is growing dark. Through the lowered blinds, faint sunlight
comes in, but it is already dark in the room. Only the small lamp on
the table brings out into bold relief the white heads of David and
Anathema.</i></p>

<p><i>David is sitting by the table. His hair and beard, unkempt for some
time, lend him a savage and terrible appearance; his face is emaciated,
his eyes are wide open; clasping his head with both hands, he stares
fixedly through his large spectacles, examines a paper, throws it
aside, takes up another paper, and nervously turns the leaves of a
heavy volume.</i></p>

<p><i>Anathema stands near him, holding the back of his arm-chair. He is
motionless, thoughtful, and stern.</i></p>

<p><i>The windows are closed, but through the dosed windows comes the
muffled noise of many voices. It increases slowly, wavering in force
and impassionateness. Those who had been called by David are now
besieging his house. Silence.</i></p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>It has crumbled away into dust; Nullius! The mountain that reached the
sky has split into rocks, the rocks have turned into dust, and the
wind has carried the dust away. Where is the mountain, Nullius? Where
are the millions which you brought me? Here I have been looking for an
hour through my papers for one copeck, only one copeck, that I may give
it to him who asks for it, but I cannot find it. What is lying around
there?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>The Bible.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>No, no, I mean there, among the papers. Let me have it. I think it is
an account I haven't examined yet. That would be good luck, Nullius!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Stares intently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>No, it is all crossed out here. Look, Nullius, look! A hundred, then
fifty, then twenty,&mdash;and then one copeck. But I cannot take this copeck
away from him, can I?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Six, eight, twenty,&mdash;correct.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>No, no, Nullius,&mdash;one hundred, fifty&mdash;twenty,&mdash;one copeck. It has all
melted away, it slipped through my fingers like water. And the fingers
are dry already&mdash;and I feel cold, Nullius!</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>It is warm here.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>I say it is cold here, Nullius. Throw some logs of wood into the
fireplace.... No, wait. How much does a log cost? Oh, it costs a great
deal; put it away, Nullius,&mdash;this accursed fire is devouring wood
so quickly, as though it did not know that every log of wood is&mdash;a
life. Wait, Nullius.... You have a splendid memory, you never forget
anything, like a book&mdash;don't you remember how much I designated for
Abraham Khessin?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>At first, five hundred.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Nullius, of course,&mdash;he is an old friend of mine; we used to
play together. And for a friend five hundred is not much at all. Of
course, he is an old friend of mine, and I must have pitied him and
left to him more than to the others in the end&mdash;for our friendship is
such a tender feeling, Nullius. But it is bad if a man wrongs strangers
and distant people on account of a friend&mdash;for they have no friends or
protection. And we will cut down Abraham Khessin's allowance, we will
cut it down just a little bit....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>With fear.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Tell me, how much have I now allowed for Abraham?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>One copeck.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Impossible! Tell me that you have made an error! Have pity on me, and
tell me that you have made an error, Nullius! It cannot be&mdash;Abraham
is my friend&mdash;we used to play together. Do you understand what it
means when children play together, and then they grow up and they have
grey beards, and they smile together at the past? You have also a grey
beard, Nullius.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Yes, my beard is grey. You allowed one copeck for Khessin.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Takes Anathema by the arm; in a whisper.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But she said that her child would die, Nullius,&mdash;that he is dying
already. Understand me, my old friend, I must have money. You are such
a fine man, you are (<i>pats his arm</i>) such a kind man, you remember
everything, like a book,&mdash;search a little more.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Bethink yourself, David; your reason is betraying you. It is already
two days that you have been sitting here at this table, looking for
that which is no more. Go out to the people who are waiting for you,
tell them that you have nothing left, and dismiss them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Angrily.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>But did I not go out ten times already to the people and did I not
tell them that I have nothing left? Did a single one of them go away?
They stand and wait there, and they are firm in their misery, like a
rock, obstinate like the child at the mother's breast. Does a child ask
whether there is milk in the mother's breast? When I speak, they are
silent and they listen to me like reasonable people; but when I become
silent, the spirit of despair and want seizes upon them and wails in a
thousand voices. Did I not give everything away to them, Nullius? Did
I not cry out all my tears? Did I not give them away all the blood of
my heart? What are they waiting for, Nullius? What do they want of the
poor Jew, who has already exhausted his life?...</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>They are waiting for a miracle, David.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Rising, with fear.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Be silent, Nullius, be silent,&mdash;you are tempting God. Who am I that I
should perform miracles? Bethink yourself, Nullius. Can I make two
copecks of one? Can I come over to the mountains and say: "Mountains
of the earth, turn into mountains of bread and satisfy the hunger of
the hungry"? Can I come over to the ocean and say: "Sea of water as
salty as tears, turn into a sea of milk and honey and quench the thirst
of the thirsty"? Think of it, Nullius!</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Did you see the blind?</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Only once did I dare lift my eyes,&mdash;but I saw strange, grey people,
into whose eyes some one had spat something white, and they feel the
air as if it were a danger, and they fear the earth as though it were a
horror. What do they want, Nullius?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Did you see the sick and the maimed, with organs of the body
missing,&mdash;did you see them crawl on the ground? Out of the pores of the
earth they come like a perspiration of blood&mdash;the earth is of them.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Be silent, Nullius.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Did you see people who are devoured by their conscience: their face is
dark, as though scorched by fire, and their eyes are surrounded with
white rings, and they run about in a circle like mad horses? Did you
see people who look straight ahead, and in their hands they hold long
staffs for measuring the road? These are the people searching after
truth.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>I dared not look any further.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Did you hear the voice of the earth, David?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter Sarah; she advances to David timidly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Is that you, Sarah? Shut the door tightly, do not leave a crevice
behind you. What is it you wish, Sarah?</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>With fear and faith.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Are you not entirely prepared yet, David? Make haste and go out to the
people: they are tired of waiting and many of them fear death. Dismiss
these, for others are coming, David, and soon there will be no place
for a man to stand. The water has already given out in the fountains
and they are not bringing any bread from the city, as you have ordered,
David.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Uplifting his hands; horrified.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Awaken, Sarah, sleep has enmeshed you in nets of cunning and your heart
is poisoned with the madness of love. It is I, David!...</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>With fear.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And I did not command to bring bread.</p>

<p class="char">SARAH.</p>

<p>If you are not quite ready, David, they can wait. But order lamps
lighted and give bedding for the women and the children,&mdash;for night
will soon set in and the earth will grow cold. And order them to give
milk to the children&mdash;they are starved. There, in the distance, we have
heard the sound of innumerable footsteps: are those not herds of cows
and goats, full of milk, driven here at your command?</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Hoarsely.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, my God, my God!...</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>In a low voice, to Sarah.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Go away, Sarah: David is praying. Do not disturb his prayer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Sarah goes away timidly and cautiously.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Mercy! Mercy!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The noise outside the windows subsides. Suddenly
it is heard again: Sarah had notified them that
they must wait.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Mercy! Mercy!</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>In a commanding tone.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>David be a man in the face of the great fear. Did you not call them here? Did
you not call loudly, in a voice of love, to the silence and the
darkness where unspeakable horror dwells? And now they have come to
you&mdash;North and South, East and West, and like four oceans of tears they
have stretched themselves at your feet. Rise, David!</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>What shall I do, Nullius?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Tell them the truth.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>What shall I do, Nullius? Shall I perhaps take a rope and, hanging it
upon a tree, strangle myself like the one who had once betrayed? Am
I, perhaps, a traitor, having called them and not given anything to
them, and loving them in order to destroy them? Oh, how my heart is
aching!... Oh, how my heart is aching, Nullius! Oh, I feel as cold as
the ground that is covered with ice, and within it there is heat and
white flame. Oh, Nullius, have you seen the white flame on which the
moon turns dark and the sun burns like yellow straw?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He tosses about.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Hide me, Nullius. Is there not a dark room, where the light does
not penetrate? are there not strong walls through which I would not
hear these voices? Whither are they calling me? I am a sick old man, I
cannot endure and suffer so long&mdash;I myself had small children, and did
they not die? What were their names, Nullius? I have forgotten. Who is
it they call David, the man who has brought joy to mankind?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>That was your name, David Leizer. You are deceived, Leizer. You are
deceived even as I am deceived!</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>With entreaty.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Protect me, Nullius. Go out to them and tell them aloud, so they
all can hear: "David Leizer is a sick old man, and he has nothing
left." They will listen to you, Nullius,&mdash;you have such a respectful
appearance,&mdash;and they will return to their homes.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, David. You see the truth already, and you will soon proclaim
it to the people. Ha, ha! Who said that David Leizer could perform
miracles?</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Folding his arms.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes, Nullius.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Who dares demand miracles of Leizer? Is he not a sick old man,&mdash;mortal
like all the rest?</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Nullius,&mdash;a man.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Did not love deceive Leizer? It said to him: "I shall do
everything,"&mdash;and it raised only dust on the road like the blind wind
from behind a corner, which bursts in noisily and lies down quietly,
which blinds the eyes and stirs up the dust. Let us go, then, to Him
who gave love to David, and ask Him: "Wherefore did you deceive our
brother David?"</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Nullius! Of what good is love to man if it is powerless? Of
what good is life if there is no immortality?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Rapidly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Go out and tell this to them,&mdash;they will listen to you. They will lift
their voice to Heaven&mdash;and we shall hear the answer of Heaven, David!
Tell them the truth and you will stir up the earth.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>I am going, Nullius. And I will tell them the truth&mdash;I have never lied.
Open the doors, Nullius.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Anathema quickly throws the door open and
respectfully allows David to pass to the balcony.
David walks slowly, with an air of importance. Then
Anathema closes the door behind David. The noise
suddenly subsides, a deathlike silence sets in, and
David's quivering voice is heard faintly. Anathema
dances about the room in a fit of ecstasy.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Ah! you would not listen to me,&mdash;now listen to them. Ah! you forced me
to crawl on my belly like a dog. You would not permit me to glimpse
even through a crevice!... You laughed at me in your silence!... You
tortured me by your motionlessness. Listen, then, and answer, if you
can. It is not the Devil who speaks to you, it is not the son of Dawn
who raises his voice,&mdash;it is man, it is your favorite son, your care,
your love, your tenderness, and your proud hope, that is wriggling
under your foot like a worm. Well? You are silent? Lie to him by your
thunder, deceive him with your lightning,&mdash;how dares he look into the
heavens? Let him, like Anathema?</p>

nothing,&mdash;but here I went out to them, I saw them and suddenly I felt

believe it myself; I spoke, and yet I felt that I stood with them and
shouted against myself, and demanded angrily.... With my lips I declare
that I have nothing,'and with my heart I promise them, and with my
eyes I cry out, Yes, yes, yes! What shall I do, Nullius? Tell me, are

dead so long. I did not know this,&mdash;forgive me. And when he was dying,
I promised him: "Moishe, do not be afraid to die&mdash;David, who brings joy
to mankind, will restore your little life to you."</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Show him to me.</p>

<p>Wait for me, David. I shall go out at once and see whether the house is

<p>Yes, yes, look. They are such madmen! Meanwhile I shall prepare myself,
Nullius.... But I ask you, do not leave me here all alone for a long
time.</p>

<p><i>Anathema goes out. David goes cautiously on tiptoe
to the window and wants to look out, but he dares
not; he goes to the table and is frightened by the
scattered sheets of paper; he moves cautiously
to the corner where his clothes are. He dresses
hastily, mixing up his clothes. For a long time he
does not know what to do with his beard; suddenly
he pushes it under his coat and hides it with his
collar.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes. I must hide my beard. All the children know my beard.... But
why did they not tear it out? Yes, yes, my beard.... But what a black
coat! It does not matter, you will hide it. That's the way. Rosa had a
mirror.... But Rosa ran away, and Naum also died, and Sarah&mdash;oh, but
why does not Nullius come? Does he not hear how they are shouting?...</p>

<p><i>A knock on the door.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Well, Nullius,&mdash;it is possible to recognize me now, is it not?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Very good, David. But I don't know how we can get out. Sarah has
filled the house with guests: in every room the blind and the maimed
are waiting for you with a pleasant smile; there are also dead people
there, David. Your Sarah is a splendid woman, but she is too much of
a hostess, David, and she intends to build up a fine household on
miracles.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>But she must not do it, Nullius.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Many people are already sleeping at your doors, smiling in their

the others.... And in the garden and in the yard....</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p><i>With fear.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What is there in the yard?...</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Not so loud, David. Look and listen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He puts out the light in the room and draws aside
the draperies; the windows are lit up with a red
light; it is dark in the room, but David's head,

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Also in a whisper.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>'Tis a cold night, and they have started bonfires. Sarah told them that
they would have to wait a long time yet, so they have taken precautions.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Where did they get the wood?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>They broke certain things. Sarah told them that you ordered them to
start bonfires, and they are humbly burning whatever wood they find....
And there, David, farther away....</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>I do not know, David. But from the upper window, which was wide open,
I heard something like the roaring of the ocean when the rocks tremble
with pain from the beating of the breakers; it was as though the
roaring of brass trumpets that I heard, David,&mdash;they are shouting to
the sky and to you, and they are calling you.... Do you hear?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>In the muffled noise and chaos of sounds, ring out
the sounds: Da-vid! Da-vid! Da-vid!</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>I hear my name. Who is calling? What do they want?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>I don't know. Perhaps they want to crown you as their king.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>You, David Leizer. Perhaps they are bringing you might and power&mdash;and
the power of performing miracles&mdash;do you not want perhaps to become a
God, David? Look and listen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He throws the windows wide open. The sounds of
the voices calling "Da-vid, Da-vid, Da-vid!"
grow louder and are mingled with the blowing of
trumpets.</i></p>

<p><i>David at first moves to the wall, then he slowly
advances to the window. He straightens himself,
looks out of the window, and pushing Anathema
aside, outstretches his arms to the poor of the
earth.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

Nullius,&mdash;they have lifted their heads, they are looking, they hear me.
This way! this way!</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Will you perform miracles?</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Angrily.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Be silent&mdash;you are a stranger. You speak as an enemy of God and
mankind. You know neither pity nor compassion. We are tired, we are
exhausted,&mdash;even the dead have grown tired of waiting. Come here&mdash;and
we shall go together. This way!</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Who needs the road if not the lame? This way, maimed!</p>

<p>Yes, yes, let us flee.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>No, I don't want to go to Him. What will God tell me? And what shall I
answer Him? Be considerate, Nullius. Can I say anything in answer to
God now?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>I shall lead you to the desert. We shall leave here these wicked and

<p>But they are human beings, Nullius.</p>

<p>Renounce them, and, pure, stand up in the desert before the face

your friend, let only the sky and the sand hear the penitent moans
of David&mdash;not a single stain of another's sin shall come upon the
pure snow of his soul. He who remains with lepers becomes a leper
himself&mdash;only in solitude will you see God. To the desert, David, to
the desert!</p>

<p><i>On the right, upon the slope of a mountain, a dilapidated stone fence.
On the left, the sea is seen. Beyond the fence, a deserted garden;
among the trees two tall cypress trees stand out prominently. The sea
is dark. It is before a storm. The sky is overcast with heavy clouds,
which are driven rapidly by the wind.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain goes up no one is on the stage; then Anathema climbs
over the fence and assists David over the fence. David is very weak and
moves with difficulty. Their dark clothes are covered with mud and torn
in places. Both have lost their hats on the way.</i></p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Quicker, quicker, David! They are pursuing us. In this dark garden,
where it is so quiet, I heard a roaring in the distance, on that
side,&mdash;as though there were another sea there. Quicker, David!</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>I can't, Nullius. Put me down here that I may die.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Put your foot here, on this rock. Take care.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Before my eyes are paths which turn and turn and lead to the wall. Then
there are more walls, Nullius, and this dark ditch where a bloated dead
horse is lying. Where are we, Nullius?</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>We are at the sea. We shall take a boat from the fishermen and trust
ourselves to the waves&mdash;You will sooner find mercy with the senseless
waves, David, than with the maddened people.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Yes, it is better to die.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He lies down by the fence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I am fifty-eight years old, Nullius, and I must have a rest.... But who
was the man that met us on the highway and was so greatly overjoyed,
and ran off shouting: "Here is David, who has brought joy to mankind?
How does he know me? I had never seen him before.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Shutting his eyes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The cypress trees have turned dark&mdash;there will be a storm to-night,
Nullius. We should have remained at the stone pit: it was dark and
quiet there, and I slept like a man with clear conscience.</p>

<p>What else is there to search for? We have searched enough to-day, and
we jumped like trained dogs. I felt ashamed, Nullius, when I climbed
the fences like a little boy stealing apples. You had better come over
here and tell me something about your wanderings. I am too tired to
sleep.</p>

<p>That&mdash;of course, Nullius, that is the echo of the waves of the sea.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>No. It is the voice of the people, who will come here soon and will
demand miracles from you, and will offer you the kingdom of the poor on
earth. When we were hiding in the rocks, I heard two men speak as they
hastened to the city: they said that you had been carried away by some
evil one and that it was necessary to rescue you from that evil one and
offer you the kingdom.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

sleep of the horse which draws water. They are carrying a crown and
death&mdash;and their victim and master is catching the wind with an open
mouth, smacking his lips for pleasure. O miserable race! There is
treachery in your bones, betrayal in your blood, and falsehood in your
heart! It is better to rely upon flowing waters, to walk upon the waves
as upon a bridge; it is better to lean upon the air as upon a rock,
than to trust one's haughty anger and bitter dreams to a traitor.</p>

<p>What shall I do, Nullius? Shall I, mayhap, hurl myself down and dash my
head against the rocks? But am I a wicked wretch that I should come to
God without His calling me? Oh, if God only called me&mdash;faster than an
arrow would my old soul rush to Him....</p>

<p>But make haste, David; they are near.</p>

<p class="char">DAVID.</p>

<p>Do you hear? They are coming. I love them, but my love is bitterer than
hatred, and it is as powerless as indifference. Kill me, and meet them
yourself. Kill me&mdash;and meet them with mercy, with love. Fertilize the
hungry earth with my body and grow bread upon it, drown sorrow with my
soul and grow laughter upon it. And joy, O Lord, joy for mankind....</p>

haste, David, for many have died already of unbearable sufferings&mdash;and
the dead have already grown tired of waiting. And many have already

the rocks like a thief. Like a conqueror, he is trying to seal his
victory by his haughty gait, by the importance of his slow movements.
But as the Devil can never be truthful, and as there are no bounds
to his doubts, he brings his duality even into this: He walks like
a conqueror, yet he is afraid; he throws his head back high like a
sovereign, and yet he laughs at his exaggerated self-importance; a
gloomy and malicious clown, he longs for greatness; and forced to
laugh, he despises laughter.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus, assuming important airs beyond measure, he goes up to the
middle of the mountain and waits there in a haughty pose. But his
uncertain importance is devoured by the silence, even as dry wood is
devoured by fire&mdash;and he begins to hurry, without holding out the
pause, like a poor musician, striving to conceal himself and his doubts
and his odious fear in a vast deal of jests, in loud shouting and in
rapid gestures. He stamps his foot and shouts in a voice of assumed
sternness.</i></p>


<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Why are there no trumpets here? Why no celebration? Why are these old
and rusty gates closed? And why does no one hand me the keys? Is it
proper in decent circles to meet thus an eminent guest, the reigning
prince of the earth, which is friendly to us? Only the doorkeeper is
here, apparently asleep, and no one else. It is bad&mdash;bad!</p>

<p><i>He bursts into laughter, and stretching himself wearily, sits down
upon a rock. He speaks humbly and with an air of fatigue.</i></p>

<p>But I am not vainglorious. Trumpets, flowers, and shouting&mdash;all this is
useless! I myself heard at one time how the people trumpeted glory for
David Leizer, but what has come of it?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He heaves a sigh.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>It is sad to think of it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He whistles mournfully.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>You have surely heard of the misfortune that has come upon my friend
David Leizer? I remember when I last chatted with you,&mdash;you did
not know this name then.... But do you know it now? It is a name to
be proud of! When I left the earth, the entire earth in a million
of hungry throats called this glorious name, shouting: "David is a
deceiver! David is a traitor! David is a liar!" Then it seemed to me
that some of the people reproached also another one&mdash;for my honest
friend, who died an untimely death, did not act so incautiously in his
own name.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Guardian is silent. And Anathema shouts now
with an air of real triumph, breathing malice.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The name! Call the name of him who has ruined David and thousands of
people! I, Anathema, have no heart, my eyes have dried up from the fire
of Hell, and there are no tears in them, but if the tears were there I
would have given them all to David. I have no heart, but there was an
instant when something five trembled in my chest, and I was frightened:
I wondered whether a heart could be born. I saw how David was perishing
and thousands of people with him, I saw how his spirit, grown dark,
curled up piteously like a dead worm in the sun, was hurled down into
the abyss of non-existence, into my abode of darkness and death....
Tell me, are you not the one who has ruined David?</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN OF THE ENTRANCES.</p>

<p>David has attained immortality, and he lives forever in the
deathlessness of fire. David has attained immortality, and he fives
forever in the deathlessness of fight, which is fife.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Dumfounded, Anathema falls to the ground and lies
motionless for an instant. Then he lifts his head,
which is as angry as that of a serpent. He rises
and speaks with the calm of boundless wrath.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>You fie! Forgive me my daring, but you fie. Surely your power is
immense&mdash;and you can give immortality to a dead worm that has turned
black from the sun. But would that be just? Or do the numbers fie to
which you, too, must submit? Or do all the scales fie, and is all your
world nothing but one fie,&mdash;a cruel and mad game of laws, a malicious
laugh of a despot at the dumbness and submissiveness of the slave?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He speaks gloomily, in the grief of deathless
blindness.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>I am tired of searching. I have grown tired of life, of aimless
tortures&mdash;of the quest after the ever elusive. Give me death, but do
not torment me with ignorance; answer me honestly, even as I am honest
in my uprising as a slave. Did not David love? Answer. Did not David
give his soul away? Answer. And did they not stone David, who had given
his soul away? Answer.</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>Yes. They stoned David, who had given his soul away.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Smiling darkly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Now you are honest and you answer me with modesty. Without having
stilled the hunger of the hungry, without having restored sight
to the blind, without having brought to life those who had died
innocently,&mdash;having stirred up dissension and dispute and cruel
bloodshed, for the people have already risen against one another and
are committing violence, murder, and plunder in the name of David,&mdash;did
not David manifest the powerlessness of love, and did he not create a
great evil which could be numbered and weighed?</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>Yes. David has done that which you say; and the people have done that
of which you accuse them. And the numbers do not lie, and the scales
are correct, and every measure is what it is.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Triumphantly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>You say that!</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>But that which you do not know, Anathema, is not measured with a
measure, and is not calculated in numbers, and is not weighed on
scales. Light has no boundaries, nor is there any boundary for the
glow of fire&mdash;there is a red fire, and there is a yellow fire, and
there is a white fire, in which the sun bums like a yellow straw,&mdash;and
there is still another unknown fire, whose name no one knows&mdash;for
there is no limit to the glow of fire. Having died in numbers, having
died in measures and in weights, David has attained immortality in the
deathlessness of fire.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>You lie again!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He flings himself about on the ground in despair.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Oh, who will help the honest Anathema? He is being deceived eternally.
Oh, who will help the unfortunate Anathema? His immortality is
deception. Oh, weep, you who have grown fond of the Devil; wail and
grieve, you who strive for truth, who honor wisdom,&mdash;Anathema is being
deceived eternally. When I win, he takes it away from me. When I come
out victorious, he fetters the conqueror in chains, he pricks out the
eyes of the ruler, and to the haughty he gives the traits of a dog, a
wagging and quivering tail. David, David, I was a friend to you,&mdash;tell
him that he lies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He puts his head down on his outstretched arms,
like a dog, and wails bitterly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Where is the truth? Where is the truth? Where is the truth? Was it not
crushed with stones? Is it not lying in the ditch together with the
carrion? Oh, the light has died out from the world! Oh, the world has
no eyes!... he crows have pecked them out.... Where is the truth? Where
is the truth? Where is the truth?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Plaintively.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Tell me, will Anathema ever learn the truth?</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>Tell me, will Anathema ever see the gates open? Shall I ever see your
face?</p>

<p class="char">GUARDIAN.</p>

<p>No. Never. My face is open, but you see it not. My speech is loud,
but you hear it not. My commands are clear, but you know them not,
Anathema. And you will never see, and you will never hear, and you will
never know, Anathema, unfortunate spirit, deathless in numbers, ever
alive in measure and in weight, but as yet unborn to life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Anathema leaps to his feet.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>You lie,&mdash;silent dog, you who have robbed the world of the truth, you
who have barred the entrances with iron! Farewell; I like a fair game,
and I pay when I lose. And if you will not pay, I shall cry before the
whole universe: "Help! I have been robbed!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He bursts into laughter. Whistling, he retreats
a few steps, and turns around. He speaks
unconcernedly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="char">ANATHEMA.</p>

<p>I have nothing to do, so I roam about the world. Do you know where I
am going now? I shall go to the grave of David Leizer. Like a grieving
widow, like the son of a father who had been murdered from behind the
corner by a traitor's blow,&mdash;I shall sit down on David Leizer's grave
and shall weep so bitterly, and cry so loudly, and call so terribly,
that not one honest soul will remain that would not curse the murderer.
Insane from grief, I shall point to the right and to the left.... Was
not this the one who killed him? Did not that one assist in the bloody
crime? Did not that one betray? I shall cry so bitterly, I shall accuse
so sternly, that all on earth will become murderers and hangmen, in
the name of Leizer, in the name of David Leizer, in the name of David,
who brought joy to mankind! And when from the heap of corpses, of
filthy, foulsmelling, and disgusting corpses I shall announce to the
people that you are the one who killed David and the people,&mdash;they will
believe me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Bursts into laughter.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>For you have such a bad reputation&mdash;of a liar, a deceiver, a murderer.
Good-by.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He goes off laughing. His laughter resounds once
more from the depths. And then everything relapses
into silence.</i></p></blockquote>


<h5>CURTAIN.</h5>
